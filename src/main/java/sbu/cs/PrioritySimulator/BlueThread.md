The code defines a `BlueThread` class that extends the `ColorThread` class.
It overrides the `getMessage` method to return a specific message.
The `printMessage` method is called within the `run` method to print the message.
When the `BlueThread` is executed, it prints a message with the class name and the predefined message.
The code demonstrates the usage of inheritance and method overriding in a multithreaded environment.
