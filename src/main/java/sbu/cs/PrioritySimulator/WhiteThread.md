The provided code defines a class named `WhiteThread` that extends the `ColorThread` class. It overrides the `getMessage()` method to return a predefined message. The `printMessage()` method calls the superclass's `printMessage()` method with a new `Message` object as an argument, containing the class name and the message. The `run()` method invokes the `printMessage()` method. However, without the implementation details of the `ColorThread` and `Message` classes, it is difficult to determine the complete functionality and purpose of this code.
