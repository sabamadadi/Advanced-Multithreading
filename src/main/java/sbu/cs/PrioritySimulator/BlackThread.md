The code defines a `BlackThread` class that extends the `ColorThread` class.
It overrides the `getMessage` method to return a predefined message.
The `printMessage` method is called in the `run` method, which prints a message with the class name and the predefined message.
The code demonstrates the usage of inheritance and method overriding in Java.
By executing this code, the message will be printed when the `BlackThread` is run.
