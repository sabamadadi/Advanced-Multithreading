The code defines the Runner class, which runs multiple color threads concurrently.
It creates blackCount black threads and blueCount blue threads, using CountDownLatch to synchronize their execution.
It waits for all black threads to complete before creating and starting the blue threads.
It waits for all blue threads to complete before creating and starting white threads.
After all threads have finished executing, it retrieves the generated messages and prints them to the console.
